- add single line to run current example as docker container
- package as desktop zip file -> put on s3?
- append version to dump files for desktop?
- service to generate zip files for desktop on demand?
- use guides/html/adoc, import scripts and dump files from sandbox (make s3 public?)
- only have minimal additional config? in each repo
- add project.json for the desktop related bits, figure out how to integrate project.json into adoc, 
- probably just generate/replace default readme.adoc
- update example data page -> point to sandbox
  - stackoverflow data, tomaz datasets
  - update for cypher shell and neo4j-admin dump/load
